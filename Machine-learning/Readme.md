# How to run

## Installation

To get started with machine learning using Python, follow these steps:

1. Install Anaconda or Miniconda: Anaconda is a popular distribution of Python that comes with many pre-installed libraries and tools for data science and machine learning. You can download it from the official Anaconda website and follow the installation instructions.

2. Set up the environment: Once Anaconda is installed, open the Anaconda Prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your machine learning project. Use the following command to create a new environment and install the necessary libraries:

    ```shell
    conda create --name myenv python=3.8
    conda activate myenv
    conda install jupyter matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-learn
    ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook: After setting up the environment, you can launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in the Anaconda Prompt:

    ```shell
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser.

5. Start coding: You are now ready to start coding in Python using Jupyter Notebook. You can write and execute code cells, add markdown cells for documentation, and visualize your data using libraries like Matplotlib and Pandas.

## Getting started with machine learning

If you are new to machine learning and want to get started with Python, here are some resources to help you:

- [Python for Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/): This book by Jake VanderPlas covers the essential tools and techniques for data science using Python.

- [Scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html): Scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library in Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. The official documentation contains many examples and tutorials to help you get started.

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): Kaggle is a platform for data science and machine learning competitions. You can find many datasets and kernels (Jupyter notebooks) on Kaggle to learn from and practice your skills.

- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/): Coursera offers many online courses on machine learning and data science, including the famous Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng.

- [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/): Fast.ai is a research group and online course provider that offers practical deep learning courses for coders.

These resources will help you get started with machine learning using Python and build your skills in data science and artificial intelligence.
